# 🐳 Learn Docker — Simple and Practical Guide

Docker helps developers run applications easily inside containers.  
It makes sure the app runs the same way on every computer — no more “works on my machine” problems!

## 📘 What Is Docker?

Docker is an open source standalone application which works as an engine used to run containerized applications. It is installed on your operating system, preferably on Linux, but can be also installed on Windows and macOS.

- An application running in a container is isolated from the rest of the system and from other containers, but gives the illusion of running in its own OS instance.

- Multiple Docker containers can be run on the single operating system simultaneously, you can manage those containers with Docker.

- Docker applications run in containers that can be used on any system: a laptop, on premises, or in the cloud.

- Simply we can say Docker is a container management service.
